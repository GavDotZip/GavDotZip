Hello there!

My name is Gavin and I am a graduate student in University of Galway. I have coding experience primarily within HTML, CSS and Java.
Also experience within JavaScript and SQL. Self learned Python and currently self learning R.

My thesis for the final year of my Masters Degree with University of Galway will see me undergo a full year
of research. My research title is Traffic Simulation using Machine Learning.

For this research title I will be using both Python, R and SUMO.

Within Python I will be designing a machine learning algorithm for my traffic simulation. With R, I will
process data which has been collected from my simulation within SUMO.
